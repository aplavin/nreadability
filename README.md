NReadability
======================

NReadability cleans up hard-to-read articles on the Web. It's a tool for
removing clutter from HTML pages so that they are more enjoyable to read.

The NReadability package consists of the .NET class library and a simple
console application.

NReadability is a C# port of [Arc90's Readability bookmarklet][1].
